# Canivete

**Canivete** (portuguese for army knife) is a set of Javascript multi-purpose functions.

**Canivete** is not meant to be downloaded as a single file, its methods should be imported as needed and concatenated with a module bundler like [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

[See documentation](https://leofavre.github.io/canivete).
