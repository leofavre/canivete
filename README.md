# Canivete

**Canivete** (portuguese for army knife) is a set of Javascript multi-purpose functions; a personal and on-going project where I keep functions that I find myself writing over and over again.

**Canivete** is not meant to be downloaded as a single file, its methods should be imported as needed and concatenated with a module bundler like [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
